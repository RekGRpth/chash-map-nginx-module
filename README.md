Synopsis

Description
===========

This module allows you to create variables whose values are mapped to group by consistent hashing method.

Also you can use [chash_map](#chash_map) directive to distribute cached content to multiple disk dirves,
the consistent hashing method ensures that only a few cached contents will be redistributed to different disk dirves
when a disk drive is added to or removed from the group.

Directives
==========

chash_map
---------

**syntax:** *chash_map key $variable { ... }*

**default:** *-*

**context:** *http*

Creates a new variable whose value is mapped to group by consistent hashing method, for example:

```nginx

chash_map "${remote_addr}AAA" $variant {
    one;
    two;
    three;
}
```

The mapping is based on the hashed `key` value, the `key` can contain text, variables, and their combinations.

Parameters inside the `map` block specify a `part` in the group.

The `part` value must be text, for each `part`, the following special parameters are also supported:

*weight=number*
>    sets the weight of the part, by default, 1.

*down*
>    marks the part as permanently unavailable.

Installation
============

Grab the nginx source code from [nginx.org](http://nginx.org/), for example,
the version 1.13.10, and then build the source with this module:

```bash

 $ wget 'http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.13.10.tar.gz'
 $ tar -xzvf nginx-1.13.10.tar.gz
 $ cd nginx-1.13.10/

 # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
 $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
     --add-module=/path/to/chash-map-nginx-module

 $ make -j2
 $ make install
```

Test Suite
==========

This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The [test cases](http://github.com/Wine93/chash-map-nginx-module/tree/master/t/) are
[declarative](http://github.com/Wine93/chash-map-nginx-module/blob/master/t/sanity.t) too. Thanks to the [Test::Nginx](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Nginx) module in the Perl world.

To run it on your side:

```bash

 $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-chash-map-module:$PATH prove -r t
```

Because a single nginx server (by default, `localhost:1984`) is used across all the test scripts (`.t` files), it's meaningless to run the test suite in parallel by specifying `-jN` when invoking the `prove` utility.
